        <p>Here’s my take on Taylor Swift’s top 6 albums, ranked after years of listening (pretty accurate, in my opinion).</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>1989</strong><br>Swift’s leap into pop perfection, 1989 captures the essence of carefree joy with polished production and heartfelt lyrics. From "Blank Space" to "Style," this album defines her journey as a pop artist with memorable beats and iconic visuals, making it an undisputed top spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong><br>Known for its passionate heartbreak songs, Red masterfully combines country and pop with emotional storytelling. Songs like "All Too Well" capture the rawness of love and loss, making it resonate deeply with fans and earning its legendary status.</li>
            <li><strong>folklore</strong><br>A shift to indie-folk, folklore offers intricate lyrics and atmospheric vibes. Exploring themes of isolation, nostalgia, and escapism, this album feels like an intimate collection of stories that showcase Swift’s lyrical depth and versatility.</li>
            <li><strong>evermore</strong><br>A sister album to folklore, evermore dives into fictional storytelling with poetic finesse. Tracks like "willow" and "champagne problems" bring a cozy, autumnal warmth to Swift's folk phase, making it a refreshing, creative endeavor.</li>
            <li><strong>reputation</strong><br>Bold and edgy, reputation is Swift’s response to media controversies, exploring darker sounds and themes of self-empowerment. It’s a bold statement, and tracks like "Look What You Made Me Do" add a thrilling, vengeful energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Midnights</strong><br>A journey through late-night thoughts and introspections, Midnights explores themes of anxiety and self-discovery. With its synth-pop vibe, it feels like Swift’s musical diary, adding a new dimension to her evolving sound.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tried and Tested Starbucks Drinks Rating</h2>
        <p><address class="author"><a rel="author" href="about.html">Navya Singh</a> | <time datetime="2024-10-13">October 13, 2024</time></address></p>

        <p>Rating a few Starbucks drinks based on my personal experience - let’s see which one hits the right notes!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iced matcha with 2 pumps of chai</strong> - <i>10/10</i><br>This drink is the perfect blend of earthy matcha and spicy chai. It’s a refreshing twist that always lifts my mood and adds a cozy warmth, making it a go-to favorite.</li>
            <li><strong>Pink drink with vanilla sweet cream cold foam</strong> - <i>10/10</i><br>The Pink Drink is already delicious, but the vanilla sweet cream cold foam gives it an added creamy texture that balances the fruity flavors, making it feel like a treat every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Matcha with lavender sweet cream cold foam</strong> - <i>9/10</i><br>The floral lavender twist on the classic matcha is a sweet treat for adventurous taste buds. It’s quite strong at first, but the flavors mellow out, making it enjoyable.</li>
            <li><strong>Iced pistachio latte</strong> - <i>9/10</i><br>A unique, nutty option with a smooth flavor, it’s unfortunate that this seasonal delight didn’t make a comeback. The pistachio complements the espresso perfectly for a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple crisp oatmilk shaken espresso</strong> - <i>8/10</i><br>This autumn-inspired drink takes a few sips to fully appreciate. Once you do, the flavors come together beautifully, offering a warm, cozy drink that’s perfect for fall.</li>
            <li><strong>Chai tea latte</strong> - <i>6/10</i><br>Though a classic, the Chai Tea Latte can be a bit too sweet and lacks the authentic spiciness of chai. Still, it’s a warm and comforting choice for those who prefer a milder flavor.</li>
