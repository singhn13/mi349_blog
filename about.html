        <h2>Hi, I’m Navya Singh!</h2>
        <p>I’m a senior Computer Science student at Michigan State University. The inspiration behind this blog post came from me scrolling through my Notes app in search of ideas. I stumbled upon some random notes where I ranked things I interact with regularly (in this case, Taylor Swift albums and Starbucks drinks) and decided to share my esteemed opinions on them.</p>
        <p>Here are a few things about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually coding, or thinking about coding</li>
            <li>Hobbies include Tennis and Badminton</li>
            <li>Been listening to Taylor Swift since 2015, yet never been to one of her concerts :(</li>
            <li>Cannot live without matcha</li>
        </ul>
